# This file makes the sort_tracker directory a Python package.
# It can be empty.

# Optionally, you can make parts of your module available at the package level
# For example, if you want to allow `from sort_tracker import Sort`
# instead of `from sort_tracker.sort import Sort`, you can add:
# from .sort import Sort

# However, for this project, keeping the import as `from sort_tracker.sort import Sort`
# is clear and explicit, so this __init__.py can remain empty or just contain comments.

# No specific code is required here for the module to be importable as
# `from sort_tracker.sort import Sort`
# as long as `sort.py` is in this directory.
